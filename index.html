                      the most fish. I had hoped to finished before summer but the project became bigger than I expected. But I was having so much fun I didn't stop adding feature after feature. In total it added up to about 18 thousand lines of code. 
                      Because I knew almost nothing about the language, I spent most of my time looking stuff up and rewriting the code I just made. I had finished the app around October but kinda lost interest once the fishing season was over.
