                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">After finishing my <a href="#MorseDecoded">Morse Decoded App</a> and <a href="#BrailleDecoded">Braille Decoded</a>, I wanted to continue the idea. This app has been a long multistep process that has gone on for about a month. My understanding of Xcode and my previous knowledge of website coding helped speed up the process, which wasn't that hard.
                    I almost immediately thought of the D&D Languages, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Draconic. </p>
                    <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light"> As of now, I have only completed Draconic. The idea is when someone draws one of the symbols in the app, an AI would determine what character it is. After drawing about 700 images myself, the prototype worked. I used the TensorFlow API. 
                          It was more complicated than other methods, but it helped with part 2 of the project. </p>
                    <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light"> What took me the longest was the idea that the users would further train the AI. The app can upload images to be saved on a local database on a webserver from my computer. 
                          I made it local because it allowed me to have more control of the images, and with a few simple console commands, I can use the auto-sorted data to create a new model, which can be automatically run every 48 hours or so.
                          This new model is uploaded to Firebase, where it is uploaded and adapted by the app without requiring an actual app update.</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Much like <a href="#MorseDecoded">Morse Decoded</a>, this app only took about a week and was super fun. I get a strange comfort knowing that I know both braille and morse code if a situation arises.
                    This app made me $3 in one day! Totally blew my mind that I actaully made a notable amount in a day. In total I had only made ~ $8.50.</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">I have always had an undescribable urge to learn morse code, dispite how useless it is in reality. After talking to friends, I got the idea to test out my Xcode Swift 5 skills to make an app for it.
                    Appearently I have learned a lot from my first app because it only took me about a week to finish the whole thing. And it made me $1 is three days! A total weekly record. Making the app was super fast and fun because I knew how to do most of it from my other projects.</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">As soon as school was out, I was excited to start on a project. My sister came home telling me that she and her friends used the <a href="#CopyPasteAppv1">Copy Paste App</a>! I was excited and a little embarrassed that people actually used the app I put together in under a week. I immediately started on a v2.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">For v2, I mostly wanted to fix the aesthetics and ease of use. But I also had been looking into Google Firebase Realtime Database. As soon as my first test worked, I was hooked. I have also loved the idea of devices sharing data. There are times when I get so into my projects I can't stop, and I love it. 
                          While away on vacation, I managed to share the users' quotes with all of the people friended via a QR Code.</p>

                    <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Once winter break approched and school work lessened I gave my apps another look. After some final touches my apps were ready to be published. My parents invested the 100$ so I can get the Apple Distribution License.
                      After 8 days of realizing how strict apple is about the wording in my app, I published <a href="#Fish'sTale">Fish's Tale</a> on <span class="text-gray">December 21, 2020</span>. Then I figured I should publish my <a href="#CopyPasteAppv1">Copy Paste Game</a> app. After touching it up, it was published on <span class="text-gray">January 21, 2021</span>.</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">My brother and dad liked to fish. I wasn't a big fan, but I occasionally came along with them because I enjoyed keeping track of where they caught the most fish.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">After coding the <a href="#CopyPasteAppv1">Copy Paste App</a>, I saw how easy it was to save data on the user's device. 
                          I quickly started on an app that would keep track of where someone had caught the most fish. I had hoped to finish before summer, but the project became a larger undertaking than I expected.
                          But I was having so much fun I didn't stop adding feature after feature. In total, it added up to about 18 thousand lines of code. Because I knew almost nothing about the language, 
                          I spent most of my time looking stuff up and rewriting the code I just made. I had finished the app around October but kinda lost interest once the fishing season was over. I focused on school.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Once I got my <a href="#DistributionLicense">Apple Distribution license</a>, I published the app on <span class="text-gray">December 21, 2020</span>.</p>
