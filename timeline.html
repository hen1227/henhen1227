                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">This was my first app I have ever coded. I made it on xcode with swift 5. Right after finishing I started work on <a href="#Fish'sTale">Fish's Tale.</a> A much more ambitious app.</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">My brother and dad liked to fish. I wasn't a big fan, but I occasionally came along with them because I enjoyed keeping track of where they caught the most fish.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">After coding the <a href="#CopyPasteAppv1">Copy Paste App</a>, I saw how easy it was to save data on the user's device. 
                          I quickly started on an app that would keep track of where someone had caught the most fish. I had hoped to finish before summer, but the project became a larger undertaking than I expected.
                          But I was having so much fun I didn't stop adding feature after feature. In total, it added up to about 18 thousand lines of code. Because I knew almost nothing about the language, 
                          I spent most of my time looking stuff up and rewriting the code I just made. I had finished the app around October but kinda lost interest once the fishing season was over. I focused on school.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Once I got my <a href="#DistributionLicense">Apple Distribution license</a>, I published the app on <span class="small text-gray">December 21.<span></p>

                    </li>
                  <li class="timeline-item bg-white rounded ml-3 p-4 shadow" id="DistributionLicense">
                        <div class="timeline-arrow"></div>
                        <h2 class="h5 mb-0">Distribution License</h2><span class="small text-gray"><i class="fa fa-clock-o mr-1"></i>December 13, 2020</span>
                    <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Once winter break approched and school work lessened I gave my apps another look. After some final touches my apps were ready to be published. My parents invested the 100$ so I can get the Apple Distribution License.
                      After 8 days of realizing how strict apple is about the wording in my app, I published <a href="#Fish'sTale">Fish's Tale</a> on December 21, 2020. Then I figured I should publish my <a href="#CopyPasteAppv1">Copy Paste Game</a> app. After touching it up, it was published on January 2, 2021.</p>
